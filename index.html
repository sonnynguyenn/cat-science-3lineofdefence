						First line of defence acts like a <b>barrier to prevent pathogens</b> from entering body instead of directly eliminate them. Analogy to gate guards preventing intruders (without permission) from entering a private building.

					<h2>Alerting</h2>
					<div class="paragraph">
						<article>Some observable sympton when you get infected could be fever or swelling, this is the signal that your immune system or second line and third line of defence is protecting your body.</article>
					</div>
					<div class="paragraph"> 
						<h3> Fever</h3>
						<article>Fever is the <b>increasing of body temperature <b>above 38Â°C</b></b>. The body is benefited as high temperature could <b>slow down or kill some pathogens, this help the immune system in dealing with the pathogens.</b></article>
						<div class="img"><img src="./public/fever.jpg" style="width: 50%;"></div>
					</div>
					<div class="paragraph">
						<h3> Inflammation</h3>
						<article>Inflammation is <b>redness and swelling at the cut or infected location</b>. The swelling is <b>formed as the damaged cells release chemicals that make fluid leak into near tissues in order to attract phagocytes.</b></article>

					<h2>Fighting </h2>
					<div class="paragraph">
						<h3> Leukocytes </h3>
						<article>Safe guards inside our bodies are leukocytes, a type of cell <b>originated in bone marrow</b> that responsible for fighting infection. These cells <b>migrate from their bone marrow to bloodstream and lympathic system.</b> Leukocytes are divided into two types, <b>phagocytes and lymphocytes.</b> </article>
					</div>
					<div class="paragraph">
						<h3>Phagocytes</h3>
						<article>
							Phagocytes <b>send macrophages into the blood</b>, they will <b>consume any foregin cells they encounter.</b> The <b>consumed cells will be surrounded with membrance and form a vesicle, the macrophages release special enzymes to break down and neutralize the foreign cells. The phagocytes idenfity the antigen of the invaders and send the information to lymphocytes.</b>

					<div class="paragraph">
						<h3>Lymphocytes</h3>
						<article>
							A group of lymphocyte cells is <b>T-cells search for infected body cells and kill them.</b> While that, <b>B-cells used information from phagocytes to create antibodies, which can destroy invading cells by matching the antigens like a latch.</b> These antibodies are created and circulated through the body.
